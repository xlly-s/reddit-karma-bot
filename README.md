# reddit-karma-bot


A bot that scrapes the front page of Hacker News, checks if each link has been posted to Reddit, and automatically submits it if it has not been posted.

It attempts to determine a good subreddit to submit to based off of keywords in the post title. If not suitable subreddit is found, it defaults to /r/technology.

Earned ~90,000 karma before my account was banned from posting in /r/technology and /r/apple, the bulk of where karma was coming from.

Simply run 'install.py', then 'main.py'
